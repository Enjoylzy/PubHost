# Oral English 1st presentation: absurdity and absurdism in modern life



## Introduction

Do you sometimes feel the world absurd? Well to some extent, we are all absurd. And also, there may be a moment when we feel true absurdity deep within our heart, followed by being confused.

## Outline

Today, I'm going to talk about absurdism, founded by Camus, and why should we defy absurdity encountered in life. I'll explain the source of absurdity first, then absurdism's way of reaction, and lastly why we need absurdism in modern life.

## Body: theory of absurdism

### 1. sense of absurdity

In Camus's theory, the sense of absurdity start from flashing of sanity in pursuit of reason, which makes us doubt. For example, when we sit at a table but do nothing more than staring at nowhere, we may have a sense of nihility, or nothingness, followed by being confused. It appears when we suddenly found nothing centered in our life and no reason for our action. 

And why? To some extent, absurdity results from our cultural and philosophical dilemmas(困境)  of our modern life, so-called "the saints are gone" by some people. With the rapid development of productivity(生产力) in the past three hundred years, some guiding ethics and explanation of the world, which was considered solid and firm, can not keep up with our life and guide us now, leaving holes in our formerly sound spiritual world.  However, they can not be completely replaced. Then, social consensus disappear, we cannot understand others well, and absurdity is born.

Let's take China for example. We can include traditional Chinese values in four words/phrases, which are loyalty(忠), filial piety(孝),  brotherhood(悌), and integrity(廉). They functioned well in the ancient agricultural society. But nowadays, nearly no young people would like to farm for poor profit, and the economic mode encourage people to compete instead of cooperating. So for young people growing up with the guidance of "love others and be true", they may be confused for finding that no one really cares about them when they just stepped into society.

### 2. reaction of absurdism: facing & learning from absurdity

So, the sense of absurdity indicates contradiction of inability to completely understand the world with human reason, and the desire to do so. Faced with this, commonly we have two choices. We can admit our inability and focus on our daily life, or we can insist and devote ourselves to religion or philosophy. However, to Camus, both are trying to run away from absurdity--even for some people working on religion or philosophy, they are trying to fill the vacancies of the saints. But Camus refused to do so. Instead, he thought we should face absurdity directly, try to understand the world, guide our life with our own knowledge and experience, and see anything beyond that unreliable-- only then can we defy all social constraints, or so called "meanings", and live a free, full and passionate life. Finally, after going through and learning from adequate amount of absurdity, we will greatly develop our rationality, getting a much deeper understanding of the world.

### 3. absurdism and modern life: defying modern absurdity

So, do we need absurdism now? Yes. Nowadays, absurdism is especially important as we can see much more absurdity through the Internet now. For example(potential examples wide spread on the internet: 老八、孙笑川、丁真、科比) , how should we view appreciation of odd behavior, like a person enjoyed himself in washroom? How should we view people who intend to act as a clown to get attention? How should we view media violating their own guiding instructions and criticism?  How should we view the popularity of dark/"hellish" humor?Maybe as young generation, our ultimate challenge is what should we do when there's a big gap between what we were educated to believe and what it really is when it comes to worldly-wise scenes and the explanation of the world. With absurdism, we can get rid of excessive worries, beat deep confusion, and then keep going.

## Summary

In short, absurdity results from inability to understand, which originates in our modern dilemmas. Instead of running away, absurdism tells us to face it directly and develop our rationality from it. After all, in words of Kierkegaard, when we fight against the great problem of absurdity, we are as great as it.

## Conclusion & acknowledgement

So next time, when you are in nihility and absurdity at a table, you can give absurdism a try. Thank you for your listening.

> I have little expertise in this field and I am just sharing what I learnt from materials I could reach, so it's okay to have a feeling of absurdity (about my pres).
